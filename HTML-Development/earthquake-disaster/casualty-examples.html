A powerful earthquake shook central Myanmar on Wednesday, killing at least three people including two children, and 
  damaging scores of centuries-old Buddhist pagodas around the ancient capital of Bagan. The 6.8 magnitude quake 
  shook buildings across the Southeast Asian country, with tremors felt as far away as Thailand - where witnesses
