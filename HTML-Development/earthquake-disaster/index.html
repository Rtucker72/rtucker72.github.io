Planning and preparing are vital parts to implementing a post-earthquake rescue operation.The more prepared a community is 
  prior to a  catostrophic events, the better chance they have for preventing casualties. One way some communities are addressing 
  these issues is by designing and implementing a crisis plan that implements chains of command and proper procedures so multiple
  municipalities can work together to accomplish their goals. Designated shelters should also be establishd prior to any event, so excavation of 
  survivors and attending to those in need of medical attention can be handled in a safe place.
