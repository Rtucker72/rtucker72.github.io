    State space planning algorithms have been considered as one of the main classical planning techniques to solve 
    classical planning problems since 1960. In this paper, we show that Transaction Logic is an appropriate language 
    and framework to study and compare these planning algorithms, which enables one to have more efficient planners 
    in logic programming frameworks. Specifically, we take \(\textit{STRIPS}\) planning and forward state space 
    planning algorithms, and show that the specification of these algorithms in Transaction Logic lets one implement 
    complicated planning algorithms in declarative programming languages (e.g. Prolog). We first provide a formal 
    representation of these planning algorithms in Transaction Logic, which can be used to automatically translate 
    \( \textit{STRIPS}\) planning problems in PDDL to Transaction Logic rules. Then, we use the resulting Transaction 
    Logic rules to solve planning problems and compare the performance of those algorithms in our simple interpreter 
    implemented in XSB Prolog. We use several case studies to show how the linear \( \textit{STRIPS}\) planning 
    algorithm is faster than forward state space search. Our experiments highlight the fact that a planner implemented 
    by logic programming framework can become faster if an appropriate planning algorithm is applied.
