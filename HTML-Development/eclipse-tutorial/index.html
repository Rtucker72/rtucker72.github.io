A 5.9-magnitude earthquake hit northwestern Tanzania, killing 11 people and leaving dozens injured, state media reported. 
  At least 192 people were injured when the quake struck near Nsunga town Saturday, according to Daily News Tanzania. 
  It hit near the shore of Lake Victoria, the US Geological Survey said. The tremors rippled as far as western Kenya and 
  parts of Uganda, both of which share the waters of Lake Victoria.
